Lab A and lab B will provide some background help for this mini assignment.

Question: Software Engineering and the command-line

Software developers use the command line to support good software engineering practices. For this mini assignment we will explore a standard way that software developers organize their home directory when writing software.

For this question, you will need to make a screen shot or use your phone to take a picture of your computer screen. This photo/screen-shot needs to prove that you answered the following questions while logged into mimi.cs.mcgill.ca.

You must use mimi.cs.mcgill.ca to create the solution to this assignment. You cannot use your Mac command-line, Windows command-line, nor a Linux distro installed locally on your laptop. You can ssh or putty from your laptop to mimi, or you can go to the third floor of Trottier and use any of those labs, to complete this assignment.

You will submit a picture that answer these questions:

A. Create a SOCS account on mimi.cs.mcgill.ca and log into that account.

B. Change the command-line prompt to show your first and last name and a symbol. For example: John Doe $ or Mary Jane #. You will need to change your prompt by using either the SET PROMPT command or the SET PS1 command, or EXPORT PS1 command (it depends on your shell). See lecture notes. This change to your prompt will not be permanent. Once you logout it will revert back to what it was before.

Create the following directory structure within your Home directory (each row is a directory name and the indentation imply that it is a subdirectory â€“ for example COMP206 is a subdirectory of Projects, and ass1 is a subdirectory of COMP206. Projects is in your Home directory.):

Projects

COMP206

ass1 archive backup docs assets database

source

Leave all the directories empty except docs. Use vi to create a file named readme.txt. In that file write the following information:

Name: &lt;&lt;your name&gt;&gt;

ID : &lt;&lt;your student ID&gt;&gt;

Major: &lt;&lt;your major at McGill&gt;&gt;

Format the text file as above.

D. Use the who and grep commands in a single lined expression that displays only your login information, given the output of the who command. You will need to pipe the complete output of the who command into the grep command.

Think of a way to write an ls command that, in one screen, will prove that you have created all those directories, that your prompt has changed, and that you are logged into mimi.

Take a screen shot.

Then, using the cat command show the contents of your readme,txt file, followed by the who / grep single line expression and the output it produced.

Take a second screen shot.

WHAT TO HAND IN

â€¢ A JPG or PNG file named A1a and A1b (both pictures) showing that you completed all the requirements.

HOW IT WILL BE GRADED

The assignment is worth a total of 20 points.

o 4 points for changing the prompt to show your first and last name and symbol. The student is permitted to have other things present in the prompt in addition to their name, if they want. It does not impact the grade. Displaying your username is not acceptable.

o 6 points for the correct directory structure. The student needs to be able to show in a single image that the solution was created within their account, on mimi, and all the folders created in the requested arrangement. This question also tests their ability to log into mimi and use the server, therefore a solution using the command line from their laptop is not acceptable. They can however, use ssh from their laptop to access mimi remotely. o 4 points for readme.txt o 4 points for the who grep pipe expression

o 2 points for following the assignment specifications as stated

GRADING RULES

â€¢ A program must run in order to get a grade (even if it does not run well). If it does not run (does not compile) it will receive a zero. (Make sure to run your programs from mimi.cs.mcgill.ca).

â€¢ All questions are graded proportionally. This means that if 40% of the question is correct, you will receive 40% of the grade.
